I asked her what the course of action was going to be and she didn't respond. Finally after more emails, she said she would get a Navy one and have it in the mail the next day. After waiting 10 days I contacted Carol again and she said she didn't get any (but never updated me). At this point I asked for a credit since it is the wrong item and for all the trouble and she has not given me one. I'm very disappointed that she filled an order incorrectly, without asking first, there was poor communication, and she won't issue a refund.\n",

It took about a month to arrive and the shop was pretty slow about getting back to me with a tracking number- I didn't get the tracking number until the bag arrived at my house. Be aware when buying these bags that \"tanned traditional and natural\" apparently means that it was treated with camel urine (and dung?). Thus, it smells REALLY bad- I thought that my dog had had an accident in my room until I realized that it was the bag. There are instructions online for getting the smell out of Moroccan leather bags and I was somewhat successful- it now smells more like a horse than its excrement.

Looks like a dress or skirt zipper was used, and I'm afraid it won't wear well, plus it's more difficult to grasp a tiny zipper pull than a bigger one. Otherwise, I like the bag except for the above mentioned.\n",

When I placed my order I realized it never said what side the tubs would be so I asked Jennifer and she gave me dimensions. I knew they would be plastic and on the smaller size which was fine for the price. I figured they would at least be good quality but that was not the case. They are made of thin plastic and very flimsy. I contacted Jennifer right away and she did offer to refund me my money but not my shipping charges. Since I already paid $5.95 to have them shipped its not worth it to me to pay to ship them back plus Easter is only a week away. Unfortunately I wont be ordering again.\n",

So I sent her a picture of my order which was completely wrong (I order black seat covers with Turquoise lettering and received polka dot, grey seat covers with dark blue lettering) and she NEVER emailed me back.
